# Purpose

In this project, I used two popular APIs: Bootstrap and jQuery.

## About Project

In this project, I implemented third-party libraries such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js to enhance UX/UI. I performed DOM traversals and manipulations with jQuery. Also, in using jQuery, I was able to have the user input information saved in the local storage. Please see the screen shot below.
